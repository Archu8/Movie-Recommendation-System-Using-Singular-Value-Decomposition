# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-Singular-Value-Decomposition
Used decomposing and factorization in singular value decomposition. Creating Matrix (Create the ratings matrix of shape (m√óu)). Subtract Mean off - Normalization and compute SVD Then calculate cosine similarity, sort by most similar and return the top N(Data Normalization - Rescaling)
